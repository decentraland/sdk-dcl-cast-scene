4. Open the Decentraland Editor tab, and press **Run Scene**

Alternatively, you can use the command line. Inside this scene root directory run:

```
npm run start
```

**Scene Usage**

- Publish this scene to a Decentraland [World](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/worlds/about/)
- Enter [Decentraland Cast](https://cast.decentraland.org/) to start streaming.
- Run the scene by entiering your world. The live stream should be visible inside the stream for you and any other players there.

If there are any active streams on Decentraland Cast, you can select them from the Dropdown menu in the UI.
